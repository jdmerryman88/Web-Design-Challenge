# Web-Design-Challenge

This website is designed to report the results of a weather analysis. In this analysis you will find comparison of humidity, wind speed, temperature, and cloudiness as compared to latitude. 

The homepage gives a brief overview of the analysis completed. From there visualizations can be used to further analyse the specific parameters studied. Clicking the individual graphs in the visualizations bar will direct you to the in depth analysis. Using the plots dropdown will all also direct you to these pages.

The comparison tab gives you an overview of all the different graphs on one screen. This allows for the user to see the overall summary before going further in depth to see the analysis on each individual paramater analysed. 

The data used to complete this analysis can be found in the data tab.

Clicking lattiude at any point on the website will return you to the home page.
